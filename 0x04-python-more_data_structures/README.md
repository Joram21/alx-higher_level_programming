This chapter describes some things youâ€™ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well, in data structures as we set dictionaries as a way to achieve more using python.
Here we use fn like lambda. The lambda operator or lambda function is a way to create small anonymous functions, i.e. functions without a name. These functions are throw-away functions, i.e. they are just needed where they have been created. Lambda functions are mainly used in combination with the functions filter(), map() and reduce(). The lambda feature was added to Python due to the demand from Lisp programmers.
