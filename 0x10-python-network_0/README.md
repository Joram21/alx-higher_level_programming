1.)What a URL is:
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. It consists of components like the scheme (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), domain name, path, query string, and fragment identifier, which together specify the location of a resource.

2.)What HTTP is: 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and is used for retrieving and sending web pages, images, videos, and other resources.

3.)How to read a URL: 
You read a URL from left to right, starting with the scheme, followed by the domain name, port (if specified), path, query string, and fragment identifier (if present).

4.)The scheme for an HTTP URL: 
The scheme for an HTTP URL is typically "http://" or "https://." It specifies the protocol to use for accessing the resource.

5.)What a domain name is: 
A domain name is a human-readable label used to identify a specific location on the internet. It is part of a URL and represents a unique address for a website or server.

6.)What a sub-domain is: 
A sub-domain is a part of a larger domain. It precedes the main domain name in a URL and can represent a specific section or function of a website or server.

7.)How to define a port number in a URL: 
A port number in a URL is specified using a colon followed by the port number (e.g., "http://example.com:8080"). It identifies the specific port to use for the connection.

8.)What a query string is: 
A query string is a part of a URL that follows a question mark ("?"). It contains key-value pairs used to pass data to a web server for processing.

9.)What an HTTP request is: 
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (e.g., a web browser) to request a resource from a web server. It includes details like the request method, headers, and optional body data.

10.)What an HTTP response is: 
An HTTP response is a message sent by a web server to provide the requested resource or information to the client. It includes a status code, headers, and an optional response body.

11.)What HTTP headers are: 
HTTP headers are metadata associated with an HTTP request or response. They provide information about the message, such as content type, encoding, cookies, and more.

12.)What the HTTP message body is: 
The HTTP message body is the actual content of an HTTP request or response. It can contain data like HTML content, JSON, or binary data.

13.)What an HTTP request method is: 
An HTTP request method is a verb that specifies the desired action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove), and more.

14.)What an HTTP response status code is: 
An HTTP response status code is a three-digit number that indicates the outcome of an HTTP request. It conveys whether the request was successful, failed, or encountered other conditions.

15.)What an HTTP Cookie is: 
An HTTP Cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server and stored in a user's web browser. It is commonly used for session management, user tracking, and maintaining state in web applications.

16.)How to make a request with cURL: 
You can make HTTP requests with cURL by using the curl command followed by options like -X for specifying the request method, -H for headers, and -d for data. You also provide the URL to request.

17.)What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level): 
When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the Google server for the root path ("/"). The server responds with an HTML document, which your browser renders as the Google homepage. This involves DNS resolution, establishing a TCP connection, sending an HTTP request, and receiving and rendering the HTTP response.
